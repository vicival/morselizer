This MORSELIZER is an asynchronous morse code generator sketch for ATmega328 that uses **precisely-timed hardware interrupts** .

**Unlike** most morse code generators, this one runs in **a non-blocking** way (for the rest of the code that you might add), similar to the keyboard subroutine of any PC/OS, leaving **~98%** of the processor-time available for your own code, code that you migh want to add/queue in the main loop(). This sketch is more like a library that you add around your own ideas than something you have to alter in order to squeeze your ideas into it. So, add your own heavy code to this sketch, like some LCD & keyboard interfacing, iambic keyer, morse decoder, RTTY, toaster code etc

- Morse Code generator
- ASCII to Morse Mode (when connected to Arduino_IDE's Serial Monitor terminal) 
- CW
- Telegraphy
- Trainer Mode (groups of five random letters)
- Variable Transmit Speed
- Variable Dots/Line Ratio
- Variable inter-symbols Pause
- 1 Âµs Accuracy of the duration of all dots, lines (aka symbols) and pauses
- Assures a non-blocking flow of execution of the rest of the code (meaning the extra code you might add, to run together..)
- The characters you type in the terminal are queued into an Unlocked Circular Buffer
- it uses the 16 bits Timer1 in CTC mode 12 (a mode with no other examples on the net)
- easily portable to any microcontroller capable of timer-triggered interrupts
- Arduino Uno
- Easy to understand C++ code
- basically, an Interrupt Routine does it all so it's assuring a good isolation between it and whatever code you might want to add
